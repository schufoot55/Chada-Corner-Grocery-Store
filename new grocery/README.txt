* Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
o This project allows a grocery store to keep track of how many items they have of each. For example, it will take the list and list Apples and the number 4 for the 4 times that Apples shows up on the list. It will also list everything in the inventory with the corresponding number and histogram.
* What did you do particularly well?
o I made sure that just because the user input the item they were looking for in lower case that the program would still search for the item properly.
* Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
o The one thing I think I could have done better would be use getline instead of cin incase so that if the item had more than one word it would still find it okay. Like if the store had different brands of apples like Granny Smith Apples, the user could search that and it would count how many times they are in the list. 
* Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
o Just getting the syntax correct overall was the most difficult part. A really big thing that helped me was looking at the errors I was getting and googling how to solve them also using the tools that were built into Visual Studio.
* What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
o One of the biggest things I learned from this  project is to get started on it early. I started working on this I think Wednesday evening, making sure to give myself enough time to be able to ask questions and get answers and still not feel like I was under crunch time to get it all done. 
* How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
o I made sure to comment on each block what that specific block is doing so that anyone can look at it and gather what is happening. I also took screenshots and included it in the documentation so anyone can open that file and see what is being done and how.
